# java-compiler--dry-
Creating a full-featured Java compiler using Lex (or Flex) and Yacc (or Bison) would be an extensive and complex project To give you a sense of the process, a high-level overview of how you might build a simplified, "dry" Java compiler using Lex and Yacc.

*Lex and Yacc Implementation*: We've built the compiler frontend using Lex and Yacc, ensuring robust parsing and grammatical accuracy.

*Java 8 Compatible:* This compiler targets Java 8 source code, with plans to support more recent versions in the future.

*Optimized Intermediate Representation:*  Our compiler generates an optimized intermediate representation for efficient code generation and analysis.

*Easy to Extend:* The modular design allows easy extension for new features or transformations.

*Documentation:* Find comprehensive documentation, including grammar specifications and usage instructions, in the 'docs' directory.
